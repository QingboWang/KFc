`simulated_y_realistic_chr{N}_forshare.tsv.gz` (N=1,2,...,22): Simulated RNA expression for n=465 samples in each chromosome.

`simulated_v_causals_realistic.tsv`: assignment of simulated cis-genetic heritability, number of causal variants in cis, the causal variant(s) (hg38:hg19) and the minor allele frequency of the causal variant(s).

`simulated_h2g_and_n_causal_realistic.tsv`: assignment of simulated cis-genetic heritability and the number of causal variants in cis (=Identical as the first few columns for the `simulated_v_causals_realistic.tsv`. Using the `simulated_v_causals_realistic.tsv` would be sufficient for most cases).

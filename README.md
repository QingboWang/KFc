# The Knockoff-FINEMAP combination (KFc) method
Welcome to the github page for the Knockoff-Finemap combination (KFc) study utilizing 465 COVID-19 infected samples from Japan COVID-19 Task Force ([Estimating gene-level false discovery probability improves eQTL statistical fine-mapping precision](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/5/4/lqad090/7334107), published in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics), where we utilize combination of canonical [fine-mapping tools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1493/1743040) with [knockoff genotype generation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SNPknock/index.html) to improve precision.


The scripts used in the paper are stored in the `codes` directory.


The simulated gene expression data used in the manuscripts are stored in the `simulated_phenotypes` directory.


The knockoff genotype data used in the manuscripts are stored in the `knockoff_genotypes` directory.

# The Knockoff-FINEMAP combination (KFc) method
Welcome to the github page for the Knockoff-Finemap combination (KFc) study utilizing 465 COVID-19 infected samples from Japan COVID-19 Task Force (manuscript to be public soon), where we utilize combination of canonical fine-mapping tools with knockoff genotype generatin to improve precision.

The scripts used in the paper are partially stored in the code directory. More content, including the rest of the code used for the study as well as a tutorial will be added along with the paper publication.

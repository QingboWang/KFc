# The Knockoff-FINEMAP combination (KFc) method
Welcome to the github page for the Knockoff-Finemap combination (KFc) study utilizing 465 COVID-19 infected samples from Japan COVID-19 Task Force ("Estimating gene-level false discovery probability improves eQTL statistical fine-mapping precision", planned for publication in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics), where we utilize combination of canonical fine-mapping tools with knockoff genotype generatin to improve precision.


The scripts used in the paper are stored in the `codes` directory.


The simulated gene expression data used in the manuscripts are stored in the `simulated_phenotype` directory.


The knockoff genotype data used in the manuscripts are stored in the `knockoff_genotype` directory.
